# template_portfolio

This template should help you organize your portfolio pieces. 


Inside the repository, you should see a "docs" folder containing the page source of your portfolio template.

To activate the GitHub Pages feature, go to the repository's "Settings" tab on the GitHub website.

Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.

Under "Source," you should see a dropdown menu. Click on it and select the "main" branch.

After selecting the branch, click on the "Save" button. GitHub will use the "docs" folder on the "main" branch as the source for your GitHub Pages.

Once the GitHub Pages are deployed, you will see a green message indicating the URL where your portfolio can be accessed. It might take a few moments for the page to be ready.

You can now visit the provided URL to view your portfolio.

That's it! You have successfully activated the portfolio template using GitHub, with the page source located in the "docs" folder on the main branch.
