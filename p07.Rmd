> The projects should be numbered consecutively (i.e., in the order in which you began them), and should include for each project a description of the goal, the product (computer program, hand graph, computer graph, etc.), the data, and some interpretation. Reports must be reproducible and of high quality in terms of writing, grammar, presentation, etc.

## Guidelines for Project Descriptions

Each project entry should address the following components:

- **Goal**: Clearly state the research question or analytical objective (2-3 sentences)
- **Product**: Describe the deliverable type (e.g., R script, visualization, statistical model, interactive dashboard)
- **Data**: Identify the dataset(s), source, and relevant variables used in your analysis
- **Interpretation**: Discuss findings, limitations, and implications of your work

**Format**: Use headers (##), paragraphs, and code chunks as appropriate. Aim for clarity and conciseness rather than a specific length.
